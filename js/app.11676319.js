In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeralaware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification.

However, all methods mentioned above only exploit historical data to predict stock price movement in the next trading day. Apart from stock historical data, data in text modality like finance-related news or social platform contents can also reflect the moving trend of stocks. Instead of training a new model to learn the representation of text data, we use large language models (LLMs) to directly predict the price movement of stocks. Considering the possible lack of domain data in training corpora of LLMs, we introduce in-context learning to explore if LLMs can learn necessary knowledge from given prediction examples consisting of both historical data and text data. In this paper, we focus on overnight stock price movement prediction.

Traders can effectively leverage these LLMs to analyze financial news and predict stock returns accurately. However, integrating LLMs into existing quantitative models presents two primary challenges: the insufficient utilization of semantic information embedded within LLMs and the difficulties in aligning the latent information within LLMs with pre-existing quantitative stock features. We propose a novel framework consisting of two components to surmount these challenges. The first component, the Local Global model, approaches understanding stock features and financial news (through LLMs) as a unified problem. The second component, Self-Correlated Reinforcement Learning, focuses on aligning the embeddings of financial news generated by LLMs with stock features within the same semantic space.

In this paper, we propose NumGPT, a generative pre-trained model that explicitly models the numerical properties of numbers in texts. Specifically, it leverages a prototype-based numeral embedding to encode the mantissa of the number and an individual embedding to encode the exponent of the number. A numeral-aware loss function is designed to integrate numerals into the pre-training objective of NumGPT. We conduct extensive experiments on four different datasets to evaluate the numeracy ability of NumGPT. The experiment results show that NumGPT outperforms baseline models (e.g., GPT and GPT with DICE) on a range of numerical reasoning tasks such as measurement estimation, number comparison, math word problems, and magnitude classification.

Our experiment demonstrates that the Classify-and-Rethink prompt approach effectively overcomes the framing effect and facilitates excess returns.
